# RePle
     Program made by Skymay Studio (more precisely Alex may 9)

Small description:
RePle (Rename Multiple) was created by me to solve one small, but annoying manual task: Renaming multiple files
Later down the road, I discovered other pieces of software that already did this task WAY better than this program 
and that even windows has such a functionality. So I abandoned this project.

WARNING: Because this code is made by me (Alex may 9), it is VERY messy, and not well described 
(Just so you know, and if your looking into it, have fun figuring out what I have written :D)
